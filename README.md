# html-site-nginx-image

This is a demo project with default.conf and Docker file which will be used to build custom image of nginx with our files.

here I have used nginx alpine flavour so final image size will be vey small comapre to other flavour of nginx.

This setup is done for the caprover site where we need to upload the .tar file of this folder and directly upload to the caprover app deployment.
